          I recently found puzzles to be very fun. I have to say that I'm not a very good puzzler.
          I was rejected from many programs that had puzzles as their admissions process XD.
          But I still find them very fun. Below are some of the "easier" ones that I was able to solve.

            SHEEP AND FOX (Ive been trying for a month)
          </p>
  
          <p class="text">
            There are n number of sheep standing in a circle. One of them happens to be a fox. 
            Every turn, the fox has a equal chance of moving either left or right in the circle.
            If the fox finds a sheep, it will eat the sheep.
            If it arrives at a open position (already eaten or back to original), nothing happens.
            What is the optimal position to be in to minimize your chances of being eaten by the fox?

        <div>
          <p class="subtitle">
            3 mislabled urns
          </p>
  
          <p class="text">
            There are 3 urns: one mixed, one black only and one white only. 
            But the labels are all mixed up (all of them are incorrect). 
            You can “check” an urn by taking out one ball from an urn, 
            but you might be extremely unlucky and keep getting one color balls from the mixed urn (infinite number of balls). 
            What is the smallest number of checks you need to correctly label the urns?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="subtitle">
            4 hats
          </p>
  
          <p class="text">
            There are 4 people 1,2,3 and 4. They are all wearing a hat but don't know their own hat color.
            In total among the 4, 2 are wearing black and 2 are wearing white.
            1,2 and 3 are all facing right. But between 3 and 4 is a wall. 4 is behind the wall facing
            left. 1, 2 and 3 are lined up so that 3 can see 1 and 2 and 2 can see 1's hat.
            After standing, someone confidently says what their hat color is. How can this be?
          </p>

        <div>
          <p class="subtitle">
            10 hats
          </p>
  
          <p class="text">
            This time there are 10 people. There are black and white hats but we do not know how many hat colors we have. 
            Each person cannot see their own hats as well.
            1 - 10 are lined up in a row facing right such that 1 can see 2 - 10, 2 can see 3-10 and so on until 10 is facing the wall.
            Eventually, except for once or even non, everyone can correctly guess their hat color. How?
