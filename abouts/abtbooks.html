          Thoughts
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I think <strong>books are always cool</strong>. 
          I also think this is something that I will always agree upon 
          (controversial at my school maybe, which is why I defended books against it during my ASPR interview...).
          There are just so many benefits to reading. The flow state is something that I greatly cherish.
          I love learning about different things through non-fiction (although I fall asleep more easily when reading non fiction > fiction). 
          There are just so many worlds, characters out there that we will never get to experience if not for books.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Given this it wouldn't be surprising if I had to wear glasses as a kid for reading under the dark.
          I also have reached the platinum level of the book-buying app I use (I just can't seem to read on a screen!).
          My bookshelf is too full that I have to pile books horizontally on top and 
          I pay extra fees are the airport because my bag is too heavy with books.
          I dont know, I just love books.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          I usually read SF, dystopian short stories (korean), some classics and novels about people.

        <p class="text">
          <i>If you have any recommendations, feel free to reach out!</i>
          By default, though, I am hesitant to provide recs because I think reading is done best if you enjoy the book you are reading.
          This applies the other way too, sometimes choose not to read recs because I might enjoy other books more.
          Still I'm always open to talking about em :&#41;
