        About this blog?
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        This blog was made by me. Just to get it out, appriximately 4% of the code (had some issues with css formatting) is generated by GPT asw. 
        I made the blog look like a book because i love reading, and I thought it'd be aesthetically pleasing :&#41. 
        This blog is mostly an incoherent jumble of thoughts.

        <p class="text">
          As for the <strong>function</strong> of this blog, its kind of an experiment / commitment / writing.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p class="litxt">
            <strong>Experiment</strong>: As i wrote in the cover disclaimer, i literally made this blog after learning html and css for 3 days. 
            So an experiment into how fast i can learn things. I think it turn out pretty ok. But the code is very inefficient / long so will be working on this.
            <i>if you are proficient in ui/ux (im assuming most ppl ik here are), throw any suggestions!</i>
          </p></li>
          <li><p class="litxt">
            <strong>Commitment?</strong>: This blog is a commitment to do some coding and writing. Since I actually have a <i>existent</i> blog, i'll want to write.
            Also because the blog and each page is written entirely in html (again, very ineffiective), I'll have to refresh my memory of html every time i write something. 
            One thing i regretted is that my past knowledge of C++ and python (wasn't big to begin with but was there) is lost. I hope this doesn't happen again.
          </p></li>
          <li><p class="litxt">
            <strong>Writing!</strong>: I think writing makes me more aware of how i think and view stuff. Having written thoughts for future reference is great too.
