          Recently, I‚Äôve been deep into reading random articles on the internet. 
          In this blog?, I‚Äôd like to talk about a part of what I read on <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZHWiCM4QmX8WwYajH/goal-factoring-1">goal factoring</a> ‚Äî 
          the button test<sup>1</sup> ‚Äî and another way of thinking that I‚Äôve found useful but dont know if its the "best" :&#41;.

          The button test?
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The button test is a useful method for identifying your hidden motives and goals (which is essentially the goal of goal factoring‚Ä¶).
          <br></br>
          Assume that you have an action X. From the back of your mind, you come up with {A,B,C,D,E} goals/reasons why you ‚Äòwant‚Äô to do X. 
          By reductionism (or the LEGO principle as the author calls it), if {A,B,C,D,E} is the full picture/goal, 
          it should account for X. The Button test comes in play here to test if {A,B,C,D,E} is indeed the full picture.
          <br></br>
          We do the button test by imagining whether you will or will not press the ‚Äòbutton‚Äô if you could do {A,B,C,D,E} without doing X. 
          For example, lets say that my action is to write this blog. In about 10 seconds, I can name 3 sub-goals associated with writing 
          this blog: {reflect on myself, have a safe space to write in, record random thoughts}. Now I ask myself, if I could reflect on myself, 
          have a safe space to write in and record random thoughts without having to write on blog, would I do it? Weirdly, no. 
          I hesitated to press this button. If my understanding is correct, this hesitation is what the button test is looking for. 
          Now that I know I wouldn‚Äôt press the button, I can ask myself again. Why do I write this blog? 
          This time I can come up with two more reasons: {to organize my thoughts, possibly share them in the future}. Now I press the button.
        </p>

      <div>
        <p class="subtitle">
          maybe button goals ‚Üí counterfactuals?
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Since using the button test, I found my mind naturally extending towards the question ‚Äúwhat other action Y can replace all {A,B,C,D,E}‚Äù? 
          The goal of goal factoring in this lens is to find better alternatives to X. 
          But I‚Äôve found that often, Y is very difficult to find<sup>2</sup>. So in such cases, I‚Äôve been trying ‚Äúcounterfactal imagining‚Äù. 
          Let me elaborate with an example.
          <br></br>
          Since 2 years ago, I‚Äôve wanted to be the stage manager of our biggest school production. For this, I‚Äôve continued to be in various shows as the ASM, 
          mic crew, camera or backstage crew. But as a non-theatre major, I also thought that the control room and backstage business would be a waste of time. 
          What should I do? Do I reject the sunk-cost-fallacy and just quit? Do I grind on against the advisors in my mind saying ‚Äòthis is useless‚Äô? 
          To solve this dilemma, I decided to identify why I still continue to remain in the first place.
          <br></br>
          From the outset, I found a couple of obvious goals in my continuing to participate.
          <ol>
            <li><p class="litxt">
              I can meet more people from different grades
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="litxt">
              I can see the production shows evolve
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="litxt">
              I can write about my experience / stories in the future for college admissions
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="litxt">
              I can develop better bonds with certain teachers
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="litxt">
              The sunk-cost fallacy of course.
            </p></li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text">
            So I proceeded with the button test. If I can meet people, get a paltry bonus in college admissions, develop a relationship with teachers 
            and see the show evolve as another role in production + prevent the sunk cost from going to waste, would I do it?
            <br></br>
            Very unsurprisingly, I hesitated. But why?
            <br></br>
            To investigate the reason, I imagined two counterfactuals: the world where I become the SM, or the world where I don‚Äôt and have a bunch of free time.
            <br></br>
            And after some time contemplating, I realized that my mind rejected the imagined counterfactual of me not being the stage manager. 
            At that moment, I realized that I would be (somewhat embarrassingly) jealous of the other person who will sit in the back of the 
            auditorium calling the cues. I felt like I ‚Äòwanted‚Äô to physically be a big part of production.
            <br></br>
            This is when I knew that even if I am discontent with some aspects of being the backstage crew, 
            I still kind of wanted to be the SM. Being aware of this fact and crystallizing the emotions / thoughts 
            I had about any of the counterfactuals significantly boosted my motivation. 
            I did not have the perfect solution to my ‚Äòwaste of time‚Äô problem right now, but I was happier with my choice. 
            (satisficing like this may not be the best but it was the best i can do rn)
