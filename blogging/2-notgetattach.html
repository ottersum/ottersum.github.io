          During my final days at camp, I spent most of my time writing Haikus for everyone<sup>1</sup>. 
          The Haikus, as I write in the preface of the book, started out as part of a separate artsy project. 
          But over time, they evolved into something that became an artifact in and of itself. I still like to think of 
          this artifact as (hopefully) a short thank-you note to everybody. Me leaving at 3:30 AM did not work in favor of 
          the quantity of thank you cards I left. And knowing this, I tried to give a lot of thought and emotion into each haiku I wrote.
          <br></br>
          By dinner of the last day, I had finished most of the haikus. But strangely I felt a bit uncertain. 
          Maybe it was due to what a participant once called ‘my central life conflict’ (caring too much about what others think), 
          or maybe it was just because some of the poems were, frankly, not great. Thankfully, a great instructor 
          offered to help<sup>2</sup>. (Also shoutout to another JC for offering to read them through and another amazing instructor 
          for writing witty titles). And together, we looked over the poems one last time. Since the start of the project, 
          he had given me so much help into how to ‘write good poems’. But particularly on this last day, his perceptive 
          ideas/comments went beyond poetry<sup>3</sup>.
          <br></br>
          Stepping away from this story into the topic of this post, one of the key takeaways from this day’s short lighting lecture 
          was to not get too attached to your ideas. As someone with strong opinions / holds tightly onto first drafts, 
          I found this incredibly difficult but rewarding. At first, I was startled at the idea of scrapping the entire haiku for 
          the ‘possibility’ of a better one. But as I wrote more and actively practiced this mindset, I’ve come to greatly 
          appreciate the fact that first drafts, although raw and insightful in many ways, aren’t always the best<sup>4</sup>.
          <br></br>
          As I chew over (an overly Korean expression for ‘mull over’) this ‘not being too attached’ principle to journal, 
          I wrote down some contexts found it to be helpful.

          Transitioning between different contexts is hard. As a boarding student, I often faced this—just to give it a name—role 
          confusion. To pick out a few major “personas” so to say, I had a secretly mischievous version of myself around boarding 
          students, another academic yet playful version for my day school friends, and another more quiet version of myself when 
          with my family.
          <br></br>
          One thing I’ve unconsciously done for the past few years, and consciously do now, is to not be too invested in any these roles.
          If I fail to do this, often the difference in the ‘contextually required version of myself’ and the ‘version I am right now’ 
          leads to avoidable stress<sup>5</sup>.
          <br></br>
          An example of this is when I head home during the break. Instead of acting miserable about not being able to 
          speak up at home as the ‘quiet first daughter’, I simply acknowledge the fact that 1) I don’t have to be restricted 
          by how I usually am and 2) I might be too attached to the playful version of myself that I am not right now. 
          By being more actively flexible and “free” from these ‘versions’, I can try to reduce<sup>6</sup> the discomfort that comes from switching.

          There’s this metaphor about life that I really love.
          <br></br>
          You are a bus driving through life. As you visit each station, some people get on and some get off. 
          Some people stay for the ride longer than others do. Some people sit at the front to chat with the driver, 
          while some people prefer to sit by the window to marvel at your metaphorical road / life. Some people might 
          refuse to pay or get in a fight, only to storm off the bus. But regardless of what happens, the bus keeps moving.
          <br></br>
          I think this metaphor beautifully illustrates how relationships or life in general evolve over time. 
          We constantly move onto different seasons and stages of life, and people come and go. In that respect, I hope
          not being too attached to specific stations or passengers (either friends or nemeses)
          make sure that my bus keep rolling on with good memories.

          Referring to yet another class from camp <sup>7</sup>, I think i try to be ware of spherical cows when discussing anything 
          that models reality. The essence of this spherical cow is that, although ideas and models elucidate reality to some degree, 
          they should not be blindly followed. Just like physicists model the world in spheres (with surprisingly accurate results), 
          we should see models as models and not full reality.
          <br></br>
          For me, at least, being too attached to specific models of reality inhibited my growth in two ways.
          <br></br>
          First, they restricted the entire picture. By generalizing real-life experience into a simpler model, 
          I inevitably deleted nuances. Although models “model” the world, I often think it can oversimplify things.
          <br></br>
          Second, too much model-thinking adds onto every day stress. 
          Having a model in mind is handy in that you can grasp what is happening and do something about 
          it more easily. For example, identifying the reason why you are feeling X according to a cognitive 
          framework gives you more control over X. But because I followed this framework and meta-ed things out A LOT, 
          I think I never got to feel X as it is. So, if this done excessively in my opinion, just overworks your head.

        <sup>2</sup> He wrote a verse and a couple of haikus… I am very grateful… <br></br>
        <sup>3</sup> One of the most cherished memories in camp was this moment. He just told me “you’re really cool”. I’ve never heard this before. So yea, I cried. <br></br>
        <sup>4</sup> As an application of this, I wrote about 4 drafts on what to write as the second post. I’ve settled on this 3rd one for various reasons without getting to held up by the first one :).<br></br>
        <sup>5</sup> Doing this doesn’t necessarily mean conforming to the moment. Rather it is trying to be more flexible and avoiding the active practice of being “rebellious” because I feel like it. <br></br>
        <sup>6</sup> Getting rid of it is—at the moment—utterly impossible.<br></br>
        <sup>7</sup> At this point, you might think that I’m the one who’s too attached to camp. This is true. I’m very much attached; but I’d like to think that I’m not unhealthily attached :)<br></br>
