          Ever since reading Nicomachean Ethics for teens :) <sup>2</sup> in elementary school, the concept of the virtuous middle has stuck with me. 
          The idea that virtue lies between deficiency and excess of a particular sphere framed the concept of a good and fulfilling life so clearly. 
          Since both deficiency and excess can cause social or mental challenges, aiming for the mean seemed like such an easy, healthy and moral way to reduce such things in life.
          <br></br>
          In retrospect, what captivated me was not the virtue itself but the way this framework offered definitive answers/scales to ambiguous morals 
          and actions.
          <br></br>
          A similar concept that I’ve came across is the Goldilocks zone. 
          In astronomy, this refers to something like ‘regions in a habitable distance from the sun.’ 
          This framework resonated with me as a person who registers her and other’s actions in too-muchs or too-littles. 
          Even if it is dichotomous and perhaps misleading to pinpoint specific zones as optimal, the fact that we need balance between 
          (as an example) external fulfillment / personal happiness is also valid.
          <br></br>
          To use a slightly extreme example to demonstrate, a person (planet) too near warmth/pleasure (sun) 
          will be too hot for humans: metaphorically, too many particle bumps for planets to live // too much pleasure 
          oriented stimuli for humans to function. On the other hand, a person (planet) 1 billion kilometers away from 
          solar radiation would be deserted and cold: literal lack of warmth in the planet // no metaphorical warmth to look forward 
          to as humans.

          Years have passed since I read the book. And it has also been years since I’ve learned about the Earth’s Goldilocks zone. 
          But still, I continue to notice a lot of these so-called ‘spheres’ where finding the balance might have been helpful.

          &#60;Some currently relevant-to-me examples of excess ↔ deficiency&#62;

          All these 4 spectrums have are the recent buggings I’ve experienced. Regardless of the theory itself, visualizing where 
          I am at the scale and how I feel in that position seems to help me calibrate my actions and emotions in a certain direction. 
          Noticing my purpose within extreme domains—say academic success for overworking and happiness for procrastinating—offers control 
          over my actions to either prioritize one (scores or happiness) or to explore ways to appease both goals (develop time management 
          skills).
          <br></br>
          Still, one important thing I try to tell myself is that every situation requires a different position on the spectrum. 
          Just like price becomes inelastic over short amount of time, not having enough time for a test will make you inelastic to 
          deviate from the ‘overworking’ zone. And although overworking may be on the excessive side of the spectrum, it makes sense 
          in this moment to not be in the ‘mean’.

          In the book, Aristotle also argued that the pleasure or pain resulting from an action can reveal a person’s moral character. 
          Before, I used to believe my character as ‘immoral’ because I sometimes felt pain when performing a good deed X<sup>2</sup>. In theory, this made sense: if my character felt pain while doing X or pleasure doing something opposite of X, then my action/personality and morality is misaligned. So if I truly wanted to develop a virtuous character, I would have to 1) understand the implications of X 2) 
          choose the deed for itself and not extrinsic motivation and 3) do the good deed consistently.
          <br></br>
          However, I’ve come to see that theory often diverges from practice. Just as emotions can’t be quantified <sup>3</sup>, 
          neither can the situational factors, feelings, plain, pleasure or the option space available to us. 
          Instead of trying to punish myself for feeling something I think I shouldn’t feel, I am trying to view these 
          feelings as a warning signs. Sometimes they point me to a better direction, sometimes they may not. 
          But rather than being the didactic arbiter of my decisions, the gut-feeling will help me gauge the implications 
          of my actions and how my ‘character’ feels about this action.
