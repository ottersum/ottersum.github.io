          While researching imposter syndrome to write this ramble, I was slightly perplexed to see the definition below.
          <br></br>
          <i>Imposter syndrome (IS) is a behavioral health phenomenon described as self-doubt of intellect, skills, or accomplishments among high-achieving individuals. 
          These individuals cannot internalize their success and subsequently experience pervasive feelings of self-doubt, anxiety, depression, and/or apprehension of 
          being exposed as a fraud in their work, despite verifiable and objective evidence of their successfulness. 
          <a class="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585058/" target="_blank">(Hueker et al.)</a></i>
          <br></br>
          I used to think imposter syndrome was something that anyone can experience regardless of whether or not they were actual imposters. 
          But this definition implies that a person experiencing imposter syndrome is “high achieving,” 
          making imposter syndrome somewhat of a fallacy. This version makes more sense given that my positive 
          feedback loop is founded upon the conditional that one is not an imposter.

          My experience?
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I do experience imposter syndrome, but I cannot say that I experience it <strong>every day</strong>>. 
          I have been fortunate enough to receive decent grades, genuinely enjoy certain academic things, 
          and earn recognition or be accepted to a non-zero number of things I attempt to do. <sup>1</sup>
          By default<sup>2</sup>, I feel exactly like the big fish in a small pond who belongs in the higher percentile (often) 
          only within its insular community.
          <br></br>
          However, this, I feel, makes me more prone to imposter syndrome. 
          <br></br>
          First, because I often am characterized as “getting good grades” or being “good at studying” within my community, 
          I am less open to sharing my achievements<sup>3</sup>. Although there are other reasons<sup>4</sup>, not sharing things about myself mostly 
          pertains to my fear of perpetuating this high standard that others hold against me and the proportionally higher 
          disappointment that comes from future failure. 
          <br></br>
          This applies to the opposite situation as well. Once I exit my small pond, I very quickly become (or seem to become) the imposter. 
          The unconscious and unspoken pride I might have had diminishes when I realize that there are much much larger fish in the sea. 
          <br></br>
          During camp, I experienced the latter, which led to many 1-on-1s and dinner conversations about combating imposter syndrome. 
          And from one of the 1-on-1s came the memorable idea of “own the trickster image”, where I acknowledge the fact that I am an imposter<sup>5</sup>. 
          Interestingly, embracing the “imposter” in me by actively trying to block out the fear of being exposed taught me some important stuff.

          feedback loop within the small pond?
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          My positive feedback loop went like this:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li><p class="litxt">
              There is action B: I avoid talking about myself <sup>6</sup> which is caused by either of the two below.
              <ol>
                <li><p class="litxt">
                  I believe in the notion A that I am an imposter, so I perform B
                </p></li>
                <li><p class="litxt">
                  In attempting to be humble / emotionally guarded etc, action B is performed in non-imposter syndrome situations too.
                </p></li>
              </ol>
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="litxt">
              Regardless of cause or situation, Action B reinforces and exacerbates belief A in two ways.
              <ol>
                <li><p class="litxt">
                  Affirming the consequent: Since I perform B because of A, the fact that I perform B wrongly affirms the consequent A that I am an imposter.
                </p></li>
                <li><p class="litxt">
                  Self-fulfilling prophecy: The fact that I avoid talking about myself obscures myself from myself. this creates the 
                  impression that I am truly insignificant, thus self-fulfilling prediction A.
                </p></li>
              </ol>
            </p></li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">
          In written form, the flaws in my thinking are made clear<sup>7</sup>. <strong>Action B is caused by many different ideas; 
            B is incorrectly and only attributed to A at the end. </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Thankfully in camp, the counterintuitive action of embracing A decreased A. This seems to be because, in acknowledging that 
          I am not A, I did not perform B. Not performing B provided me with a more accurate version of myself, which in turn revealed 
          new and interesting parts that did not always warrant imposter syndrome. What a discovery.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          However at this point, alleviating imposter syndrome has only been possible when I leave my small pond. When I’m still in 
          my small pond, I am more prone to compare myself to others, feel a sense of atychiphobia (fear of failure) or perfectionism. 
          I assume that this is largely because “accepting that I am an imposter” seems less plausible when I belong in the "smaller fish" 
          pool. Because I cannot fully accept that I am an imposter, I still engage in the feedback loop that results in the 
          contradictory belief that I am an imposter. Still working on solving this issue.

          Final comments
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          As I was transcribing my thoughts, I noticed my mind kept floating to three more tangents. 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p class="litxt">
            The connection between imposter syndrome, maladaptive perfectionism and more importantly, the need for cognitive closure 
            (something I had been planning to write about). These seem to have some connections that I cannot quite articulate yet in length.
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            Emotional guardedness and fear of judgment as something I struggle with daily.
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            Being scared of things I haven’t experienced (mainly larger-scale failure with bigger implications)
          </p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">
          Maybe more thoughts on this soon…

          <sup>1</sup> Although the list of rejection is growing exponentially and the rate of imposter syndrome has reached its maximum!<br></br>
          <sup>2</sup> and by “by default”, I largely mean school<br></br>
          <sup>3</sup>This may be exacerbated by the small size of my daily community…<br></br>
          <sup>4</sup>somewhat attributable to the asian humbleness or the issue of emotional guardedness…etc<br></br>
          <sup>5</sup>can be /was very helpful in being more open to opening up, less worrying, and viewing camp experience from a more purposeful learning perspective<br></br>
          <sup>6</sup>in retrospect, I avoid talking about not only my academic stuff but also my interests, preferences or anything in general…<br></br>
          <sup>7</sup>still, as most problems do, solving this is more easily said than done<br></br>
          <sup>8</sup>current solution at the moment is acknowledging A but not feeling anything from it…kind of like pain is inevitable but suffering is optional?<br></br>
