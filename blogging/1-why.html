          To introduce myself, this is a haiku + special title that some people came up for me. 
          It holds a lot of meaning figuratively and personally. I hope to live up to this haiku.<br><br>
          Now lets move onto the blog.

          For a while when anyone asked for my favorite quote, I've been reciting this one. 
          When the application for a pre-college program asked “7 words to describe yourself”, 
          I scribbled on this quote.
          When I was internally justifying random idiosyncratic choices, I mumbled this quote to myself. 
          When I had to make a quote image for a class, I used this one for its simplicity and readability.<br><br>
          But even as I regurgitated these words, I always felt a sense of uneasiness. 
          I thought this was because the quote was more of a "quote I wanted to live by" than a "quote I was living by already" <sup>1</sup>.
          In real life, I had no idea who I was. It felt wrong to say “be yourself” to myself, when “yourself” hadn't been defined yet.<br><br>

          This lack of identity had been bugging me for a while. Still, with all other questions without answers, 
          the bug (so to say) was shoved it in the back-of-my-mind closet. That was that. Until it wasn’t.<br><br>

          Recently at camp<sup>2</sup>, this problem ran out of the closet, kick me in the gut, punched me in the face, rolled me around, 
          packed me up in a bag, carried me to space and proceeded to drop me from space. 
          With a mental force I didn’t know was possible, I was pinned down. 
          As I write this somewhat humorous analogy, I can remember three instances when the “who am I” question smacked 
          the back of my head.

              1-on-1s: During a very wholesome 1-on-1, someone asked me “what makes you happy?”. 
              I conjured up a temporary one, but it did not click. I could not, and still cannot answer this question.

              Lighting talks about your life: My first your life in 3 minutes went terribly because I literally couldn’t describe myself. 
              My second one (scrawled up haphazardly over the course of 30 minutes) was better, but it still felt incomplete.

              Hamming Circles: The first problem I presented in the dimly lit bird tent to 3 other confidants was the classic 
              naive/immature problem: “I don’t know who I am”. Watching adults’ ability to talk about and solve their adult problems 
              was mind-blowing and amazing. As a 16 year old, I felt like the only person who didn’t have a idea of who I was.

          After ruminating over such experiences, maybe for the first time in my life, I think I finally found a goal that didn’t 
          have an extrinsic motivation.<br><br>

          <i>I want to get to know myself</i><br><br>

          I wanted to be the kind of person who writes awesome bios. 
          I wanted to be the sparkly person who gives 3 minute pitches on “why you should like me”. 
          I wanted to be able to explain why I like the things I like. I wanted to be the kind of person who knows and 
          can decide on which ice-cream flavor she wanted. I wanted to be a solid graph with sliver-lining edges instead 
          of invisible nodes floating around.<br><br>
          
          I started this *blog* to do exactly this.

          My hope is that this place becomes my second brain. It could store parts of myself that I cannot objectively see. 
          It could be another brain I consult for a 0.5×Hamming Circle. It could be a random-thought space for yet another PKM nerd.<br></br>
          
          Considering that parts of myself invisible at the moment, 
          I expect/know this place will be rambling reviews and applications of other's thoughts, 
          existing theories and books. My long-term expectation/wish 
          is that these ultimately connect in a more unique and interesting way—in a way that distinguishes who I am.

          The to-whom?

        <p class="text">
          As for the “public/private thing", 
          I’ve decided to keep this blog mostly private for 3 reasons (despite the public viewing centered style of 
          writing and the public git repo, i'm guessing my future self will share the link very selectively)
        </p>

        <ol>

            Courage: I’ve talked to people about the importance/merits of being “honest”. 
            Honest introspections in this blog is a step towards this. Making this public 
            will be 100 steps towards honesty. Someday I hope I can take those 100 steps!

          <li><p class="litxt">
            Content: “Will I do this even if everyone in the world is gone?” is the question I ask myself when I do any action. 
            This question, however simple, is hugely effective in uncovering true goals/wants. Ironically when I pick up trash 
            from various places, I find myself thinking ‘I would be more than happy to do this, just not when people are watching’. 
            At least for me, having other people watch me do something seems to decrease the truthfulness and earnesty that goes 
            into the thing. So when I ask “will I write truthful things even when the world is gone”, the answer is “yes, but 
            only if the world is gone”.

            Creativity: I want to write without thinking about grammar, spelling and the literary elements that some people drone on about. 
            I might start randomly writing poems or haikus (as I did at camp). I might start schizo-drawing (again as I did at camp). 
            I might do experimental stuff that doesn’t seem very cool from an objective lens<sup>3</sup>. To amplify creativity 
            and block off (currently) 
            unwanted criticism, I will enclose this blog so that creativity bumps each other within the splace and increases per the 
            collision theory.

          For these 3C-reasons (all amusingly start with Cs, thus the 3Cs…!), 
          this blog will be private at the moment. This is at least until I get my stuff figured out yay :&#41;.

        <sup>1</sup> Illegible sentences as these will be the consistent theme throughout this blog<br></br>
        <sup>2</sup> Given the profound impact camp has had on my life, my future self will probably write a separate post about it…<br></br>
        <sup>3</sup> The subheadings of this post seems like a good example of “weird experimental stuff”. 
        To elaborate, I’ve come to notice that I ask a lot of questions. And by a lot, I mean A LOT. Reflecting on 
        this part of myself and the goal of this substack, I am embedding this so-called inquisitive part of myself
