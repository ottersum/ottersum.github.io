          <i class="text">I wrote this as a part of english class but i wanted to save it here</i>
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          i quietly stared at the tiny mountain being surprised to see myself sitting here like a stone
          <br></br>
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          people came and eventually went<br></br>
          the sun rose and fell<br></br>
          birds hooted then slept<br></br>
          winds gushed and faded<br></br>
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          the mountain and stone developed a dent<br></br>
          at some point time became hard to tell<br></br>
          maybe someone wept<br></br>
          the face reflected on the puddle was ragged<br></br>
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          the tall tree had a shadow that lengthed shortened and naturally disappeared 
          like the stone to but the wind imbued a sense of unwelcome freshness in it that 
          the sky above it looked bluer than it should be as if it were the sea falling to 
          swallow everything on earth 
          <br></br>
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          remembering mountains words that maybe humans are just visitors on earth was a struggle 
          because all that came to mind was the way his eyes sparkled when sat across the dinner table
          <br></br>
        </p>
        
        <p class="text">
          sitting here for a while the plants grew and danced along the wind and its mellifluous melody 
          and turbulent tempo and the bugs chirped while gleaming its shell as if they were the stars on the 
          dark night sky and wishing that he was there looking down at her
          <br></br>
        </p>
        
        <p class="text">
          there is a grey stone reflected on the sky that is unable to move and sadly stuck in the ground 
          or more like attached to a mountain because it shared so much of its mineral composition
          <br></br>
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          the rain erodes parts that the stone shared with the mountain and the green weed and purple 
          flowers absorb the mineral that the mountain shared with the stone while the rain masks the 
          tears of the mountain and the stone
          <br></br>
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          with time the stone couldnt stand and had to leave the mountain and was carried away 
          to the sea because it was all eroded and reduced to bits of micro atoms but the flowers 
          on the mountain were also eaten by rats who were eaten by hawks who were eaten by sharks 
          who excreted the mountain into the sea
          <br></br>
        </p>


        <p class="text">
          and in the sea the mountain and the stone fused again and formed another stone that 
          eventually shone as bright as magma and the Sun.
